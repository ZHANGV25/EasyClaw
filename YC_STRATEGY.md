# YC Strategy

## Timeline
- **Spring 2026:** Deadline was Feb 10 — missed by a week
- **Summer 2026:** Next target — apply April-ish with traction
- **Early Decision:** Can apply now for future batches at ycombinator.com/apply

## Recommended Path
1. **Now → March:** Build MVP, get 20 beta users
2. **March → April:** Iterate, collect metrics (retention, messages/day, willingness to pay)
3. **April:** Apply YC Summer 2026 with real data

## Answers to Hard Questions

### "Why won't OpenAI/Google just do this?"
They will — for their own models. That's the advantage. OpenAI locks to GPT, Google locks to Gemini. We're model-agnostic. Users get the best model for each task, switch as market shifts. Big companies build for the average of 1B users — we build for specific personas they'll never prioritize.

### "Two competitors already exist"
Emergent and Kimi sell OpenClaw hosting to developers. We sell a personal assistant to consumers. Different customer, different product, different market. Like saying "Heroku exists, why build Squarespace?" Our user never sees a terminal, never hears "OpenClaw," never configures a YAML file.

### "OpenClaw dependency risk"
MIT licensed — can't be pulled back. Worst case, fork it. Building on open source is a feature. Vercel built $2.5B on Next.js. We control the product layer, OpenClaw is just the engine.

### "Consumer AI is expensive to acquire"
Start with communities we know (CMU network, Reddit, ProductHunt). Usage-based with free tier = zero friction. Product is inherently viral — "my AI saved me 3 hours fighting insurance" is a tweet that writes itself. Telegram bots spread organically through group chats.

### "What's your moat?"
- **Short-term:** UX and consumer focus (nobody else doing this)
- **Medium-term:** Data flywheel — every interaction makes the assistant better for that person
- **Long-term:** Platform effects — browser agents, integrations, skills. The more the assistant knows you, the harder it is to leave.

## Strengths
- CMU founders
- Real market gap (consumer vs developer)
- Usage-based pricing (proven model)
- Timing — browser agents about to mature, building the platform now

## What YC Wants to See
- Working prototype with real users
- Retention + engagement metrics
- A demo that makes the partner think "my mom could use this"
- Clear "why now" answer
- Complementary cofounder pairing
